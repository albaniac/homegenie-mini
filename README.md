# HomeGenie Mini

HomeGenie mini is an open source hardware + firmware solution for building smart devices
based on the popular *ESP8266 chip*, a WiFi capable micro controller.
This project can can be employed for a variety of Home Automation and IoT applications.

**Hardware features**

- Quick install via WPS button and automatic discovery (SSDP)
- Temperature and light sensing
- RF transceiver (315/330/433Mhz) currently implementing **X10** home automation protocol
- P1 connector with 4 GPIO configurable as SPI/DIO/PWM

**Software features**

- HTTP API (subset of standard HomeGenie API)
- Real time event stream over WebSocket or SSE connection
- MQTT broker over websocket
- SSDP
- NTP client for time sync
- Scripting engine (currently work in progress)

**Mobile client**

- HomeGenie plus for Android

The P1 connector can be used for various applications such as:

- control a led brightness or drive a motor at different speed (PWM)
- control up to 4 relays to actuate lights and appliances (DIO)
- hosting other sensors or interfacing with other hardware (SPI)
- breadboard playground
