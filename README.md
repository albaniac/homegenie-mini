# HomeGenie Mini

HomeGenie mini is an open source hardware + firmware solution for building smart devices
based on the popular *ESP8266 chip*, a WiFi capable micro controller.
This project can can be employed for a variety of Home Automation and IoT applications.

**Hardware features**

- Quick install via WPS button and automatic discovery (SSDP)
- Temperature and light sensing
- RF transceiver (315/330/433Mhz) currently implementing **X10** home automation protocol
- Expansion port with SPI and up to 5 GPIO/PWM

**Software features**

- Scripting engine (\*)
- HTTP API (subset of standard HomeGenie API)
- Real time event stream over WebSocket or SSE connection
- MQTT broker over websocket
- SSDP
- NTP client for time sync

<small>**(*)** *currently work in progress*</small>

**Mobile client**

- HomeGenie plus for Android

The expansion port can be used for various applications such as:

- control a led brightness or drive a motor at different speed
- control up to 5 relays to actuate lights and appliances
- hosting other sensors
- interfacing with other hardware
- breadboard playground
